# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This is a simple Java console application that generates a Fibonacci sequence up to the number of terms specified by the user.

## 📋 Description

When you run this program, it will:
1. Ask the user how many terms of the Fibonacci sequence they want to generate.
2. Display that many terms starting from 0.

### 📌 What is the Fibonacci Sequence?

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It starts like this:
```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
```

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Make sure Java is installed (JDK 8 or higher).
2. Compile the Java file:
   ```
   javac day6/FibonacciSequence.java
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```
   java day6.FibonacciSequence
   ```

## 🧪 Example

```
Enter the number of terms you want:
6
0
1
1
2
3
5
```

## 📁 File Structure

```
project-root/
│
└── day6/
    └── FibonacciSequence.java
```

## 💡 Notes

- The program uses a simple loop to generate the sequence.
- Great for beginners learning about loops, variables, and input in Java.
